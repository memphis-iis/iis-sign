<p>In this talk I will describe Inq-ITS (Inquiry-Intelligent Tutoring System; inqits.com). Inq-ITS is a platform for science inquiry.

Instead of taking multiple choice tests on rote science knowledge, students conduct inquiry with interactive, virtual labs in the Inq-ITS system

and while kids “show what they know”, educators get real-time, actionable reports and alerts on their mobile device, as well as grading on the

practices done automatically using patented artificial intelligence algorithms. These reports and alerts enable them to pinpoint which students

need help most, and on what skills. Students can also get real time feedback from Rex, a cartoon dinosaur, in real time as they work on inquiry

tasks. All reports, alerts, and scaffolds are driven by data-mined algorithms on which Gobert &amp; her team have three patents. Efficacy and

transfer data will also be presented.
