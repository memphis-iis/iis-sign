Verb Processing and Acquisition<br />

Abstract: In this talk, I’m going to talk about two parts of research that my
collaborators and I have done recently: <br />(1) how sensory-motor experiences
influence conceptual processing, and <br />(2) how young children learn verbs.<br />
In question (1), we mainly investigated how internet use experience would

influence verb processing and representation. <br />In question (2), we used eye-
tracking technique to investigate how infants’ attention varies with verb

inputs during infant-parent dyad interactions in a natural environment.</p></center>
