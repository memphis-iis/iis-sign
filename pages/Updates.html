Great strides in technology have resulted in huge gains in communication, healthcare, and entertainment among other fields. However, we have failed to move the needle with learning across K12, HigherEd, Skills Training and Professional Development. Learning tools and applications focus on improving productivity, but, instead technology should provide the assurance that every student will reach their learning goals. Digital learning is not about watching videos and answering multiple-choice questions. But, digital learning is about digital data from full-spectrum of learning activities. We can establish a data backbone that updates user’s activities in real-time and uses that to personalize their learning. Personalized learning should have the elegance and ubiquity that Google Maps brings to navigation while concealing the sophistication necessary to power it.

Dr. Prasad "Pram" Ram will present how learning navigation technology can complement classroom instruction and empower our students. Gooru has developed a Learning Navigator -- a "Google Maps" for learning. With the Learning Navigator, students locate their current knowledge and skills, set their learning destinations and are presented with a personalized pathway of learning activities. As they navigate through their learning experiences, they are rerouted based on their performance. Using real-time data about student performance and dynamically updated information about the efficacy of learning activities, Navigator ensures that every student reaches their learning goals every time.

Learning goes well-beyond gaining curriculum knowledge to developing non-cognitive skills. Student’s motivation, self-confidence, grit, perseverance, communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity have a major impact on their learning outcomes. These can only be supported by a caring teacher/mentor. Navigator provides teachers with real-time data about student’s performance during class period, during their course and across their grades. Teachers use this data and the associated suggestions to personalize the learning pathways. This talk will illustrate some key aspects of the Learning Navigator and discuss a Navigator for Math program where students in four urban high schools in California had over 2.5 years of academic growth in a single year with a pre-algebra course. </p></center>
