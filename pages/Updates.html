<p>Pearce Edwards is a third year Political Science PhD student at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. His research interests are at the intersection of collective action, state repression, political violence, and authoritarian security institutions. He is particularly interested in political movements in Latin America, including the archival study of Cold War-era dictatorships.

<p>The success of protests depends on whether they favorably affect public opinion: nonviolent resistance can win public support for a movement, but regimes counter by framing protest as violent and instigated by outsiders.We argue public perception of whether a protest is violent shifts based on framing the types of action and the identities of participants in those actions.

<p>We distinguish dimensions of (1) threat of harm, (2) bearing of arms, and (3) identity of protesters.  Using survey experiments --one in Israel and one in the United States --we find support for framing effects. Threat of harm has the largest positive effect on perceptions of violence and support for repression. Surprisingly, social out-groups are not perceived as more violent, but respondents favor repressing them anyway. Support for repressing a nonthreatening out-group is larger than support for repressing a threatening in-group. The findings link contentious action and public opinion, and demonstrate the susceptibility of this link to framing.</p></center>
