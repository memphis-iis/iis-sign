  Pei Wang from Temple University will be visiting Dr. Hu this week.
<br /><br />
  He will give a talk on the following topic on <b>Friday at 10 AM in Rm 405</b>.

<br /><br />

  Intelligence can be understood as an advanced form of adaptation, and an intelligent system must be able to work with insufficient knowledge and resources when solving novel problems in real time. Such an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has been formalized in the framework of a reasoning model, where the notion of "reasoning" is greatly extended to cover various cognitive functions in a unified manner. The model has been mostly implemented, and the system shows many human-like properties.
