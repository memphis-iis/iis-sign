<p><b>Abstract</b></p>

<p>Recent developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, as well as developments in virtual and mixed reality create exciting opportunities for the cognitive sciences. This presentation will take Mind Labs (www.mind-labs.eu) as a starting point. Mind Labs is an initiative started at Tilburg University to explore innovative relations between corporate partners and universities to investigate interactive technologies and human behavior. Mind Labs is used as a backbone to discuss a number of research projects, including those on robotics &amp; avatars, virtual &amp; mixed reality for training and education, and natural language processing.</p>

<p><b>Bio</b></p>

<p>Prof. dr. Max Louwerse is Professor Cognitive Psychology and Artificial Intelligence in the Department of Cognitive Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence at Tilburg University.
